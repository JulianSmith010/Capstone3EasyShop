# Project Overview
Easy Shop is a web-based E-commerce application that provides a seamless online shopping experience for customers. The application includes both backend and frontend components, with the backend responsible for handling API requests and the frontend for displaying the user interface.

Bug Fixes and Enhancements: Phase two of the project focused on identifying and resolving bugs across the application. Several improvements were made to ensure smooth functionality and a seamless user experience.

# Technologies Used
Backend: Java, IntelliJ, Postman, My SQL workbench, and GitHub were all used to help develop the back end of this project.

Frontend: images, Java, IntelliJ, Postman, My SQL workbench, and GitHub were all used to develop the frontend of this project.

# Conclusion
Easy Shop has been developed to provide a robust E-commerce solution. 
It has undergone bug fixes, feature enhancements, and the addition of user authentication and category management capabilities. 
This project has presented challenges, but it has also been a great learning experience.
Overall this project was the hardest one yet. trying to fix the bugs was an experience, to say the LEAST. 
I enjoyed doing this project and learning how to use Postman and MySQL workbench to do the best I could possibly do on this project.
I hope you enjoy my work!
